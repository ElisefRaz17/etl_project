My Process:

I extracted the data showcased the amount of house rentals made during 2014 - 2021 and I was able to sort and organize over 400 rows of data that included the RegionName, ID, home values for each month based on Region. In my house_rentals file you should be able to see the visualization I have made over the extracted data.
